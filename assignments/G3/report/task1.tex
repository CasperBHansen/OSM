% Task 1: A Thread-Safe Stack

\section{Thread-safe multithreaded matrix multiplication}
In this section, the implementation of a thread-safe stack, that can handle
concurrent access by multiple threads in a safe manner, is explained. This is
done using \verb|PThread| mutex locks.

\subsection{A thread-safe stack}
The interface of the stack, as specified
in the task description, is shown in the code excerpt from the header file
\file{stack.h} in figure \ref{code:stack_h}.

\codefig{stack_h}{../assignments/G3/task1/stack.h}{4}{39}
        {Stack header file \file{stack.h}.}

The stack data structure is implemented using a simple singly-linked list,
stored in the \verb|list_t| struct, where \verb|head| is a \verb|void| pointer
to the element stored in the head node of the list and \verb|tail| is a
recursive pointer the data structure, containing the tail of the list.
The stack data structure is implemented with the \verb|stack_t| structure, which
simply contains a pointer to the list structure that stores the elements in the
stack. Hence, the stack can be arbitrarily large and memory is
allocated/deallocated on each push/pop of an element on the stack.

A stack is initialized by setting the struct member \verb|top| to \verb|NULL|,
indicating that the stack is empty, and initializing a \verb|PThread| mutex.
The \verb|stack_init| function is shown in figure \ref{code:stack_init}.

        {Initialization of a new stack.}

The function call \verb|pthread_mutex_init(&mutex, NULL)| initializes the
globally declared \verb|PThread| mutex with default properties and leaves it
initially unlocked. It is the responsibility of the programmer to allocate
and deallocate memory for the stack data structure, that is, not the
\verb|list_t| structure or the nodes of the list, but just \verb|struct stack_t|.

The function \verb|stack_destroy| serves the purpose of freeing the memory used
for any remaining elements on the stack and destroying the mutex lock. To avoid
conflicts with other threads, the mutex is locked by the current thread before
deallocating the elements in the stack. This has the effect, that whenever any
other thread tries to acquire the mutex lock, the call will block and execution
will not continue until the lock is unlocked by the thread that owns it at that
time. After this, the lock is unlocked and destroyed. Depending on the
implementation of the mutex lock, is might not be necessary to unlock the mutex
before destroying it. Also, this current implementation might allow another
thread to lock the mutex and begin work on the, now empty, stack just before the
mutex is destroyed, resulting in undefinded behaviour.
