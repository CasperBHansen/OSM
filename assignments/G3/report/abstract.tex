We discuss our implementation of thread-safe multithreaded matrix
multiplication, using a stack. Herein we detail the workings of the stack,
how it was made to utilize posix threads, and the thread-safety issues that
were considered during development thereof. This thread-safe stack is then
put to the test by a threaded matrix multiplication program utilizing the
discussed stack.

Then, we proceed to a discussion of implementing userland semaphores in
Buenos. We cover the preliminary implementation preparations, allowing the
user to perform the necessary system calls. Moving on from there we extend
the kernel semaphore implementation to facilitate userland semaphores.
