\section{A Thread-Safe Stack}
In this section, the implementation of a thread-safe stack, that can handle
concurrent access by multiple threads in a safe manner, is explained. This is
done using \verb|PThread| mutex locks. The interface of the stack, as specified
in the task description, is shown in the code excerpt from the header file
\file{stack.h} in figure \ref{lst:stack_h}.
